# 1. My name is Sara McGaughy.
# 2. I am interested in Data Science because learning more about it will help advance my career.
# 3. I have very little programming experience.  I will do some SAS programming on the job.
# 4. I took a Bachelor's-level stats class and a Master's-level stats class in an MBA program.  I do not use stats on the job.
# 5. I have a little bit of experience with R from DS700.  I have absolutely no experience with Python.
# 6. I hope to learn about R and Python in this class.
# 7. I don't care to share anything else at this time, thank you.
